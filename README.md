### Features

* 🎯 **Sectional Downloads**: Select specific start and end times to download only the desired part of a YouTube video, powered by `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`.
* 🖼️ **User-Friendly GUI**: Built with `tkinter`, offering a clean, responsive interface with drag-and-drop support and visual feedback.
* 📼 **Dual Output Options**: Choose between downloading MP4 (video) or extracting MP3 (audio) from selected segments.
* 💽 **Batch CSV Processing**: Load a `.csv` file with multiple URLs and timestamps for bulk processing. Supports `URL`, `start`, `end`, and `mode` columns.
* 🧠 **Smart Mode Detection**: Automatically handles missing timestamps or unsupported formats with helpful error messages.
* 🎨 **Theming & Visuals**: Animated title with dynamic GUI themes using `Pillow` images and background color cycling.
* 🛠️ **FFmpeg Integration**: Uses `ffmpeg` directly with hardware acceleration support (`-hwaccel`) for faster and more efficient downloads.
* 📁 **Custom Save Directory**: Save all downloads to your chosen folder instead of defaulting to the script path.
* 📊 **Live ETA & Speed Feedback**: Displays real-time download progress including speed and estimated time remaining.
* 🧾 **Logging System**: Automatically logs download activity and errors to a text file for later review.
